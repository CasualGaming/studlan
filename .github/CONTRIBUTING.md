## Conventions

### Branch naming
Branches should be named accurately and follow the following convention:

Example: feature/imagegallery-kradalby

### Commit messages
Commit messages should be descriptive and accurately describe the changes done.

### Code style
All code should be compatible with _at least_ the latest Python 3 version.

The code should follow the PEP 8 guidelines.

Before a pull request, newly introduced code should not contain any error or warnings from the linter.

## Merge approval

Rules:

1. All pull requests must be reviewed by a maintainer
2. Maintainers must merge their own pull requests
2. Pull requests from other than the maintainers must be merged by a [maintainer](https://github.com/casualgaming/studlan/blob/master/MAINTAINERS).
