# Releasing

* Check for outdated dependencies (e.g. use the `manage/check-deps.sh` script).
* Double check that it actually works.
* Check that the changelog is updated, and add version and date to it.
* Create a [new release](https://github.com/CasualGaming/studlan/releases/new) based on the latest commit.
* (Check that CI/CD was triggered and that the production sites got updated and still work.)
